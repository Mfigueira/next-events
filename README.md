## What is this?

This is a Demo Next.js Events App.

It leverages File Based Routing, SSG, SSR, useSWR, \_app.js, \_document.js, optimization with next/image, metadata with next/head, API routes with GET and POST to Firebase RTDB, and app wide notifications state with Context API.

Based on the lectures from Academind's Next.js course and enhanced with personal touches.

Used .env.local file to configure Firebase RTDB access (Added to Vercel upon deployment).
